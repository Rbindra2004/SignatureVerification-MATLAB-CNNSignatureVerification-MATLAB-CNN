# SignatureVerify-CNN

A CNN-based handwritten signature verification system developed in MATLAB. The model achieves up to **91â€“92% accuracy** on a publicly available signature dataset, outperforming deeper networks like ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG16 in this specific task.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is from Kaggle:  
[Handwritten Signatures â€“ Divyansh Rai](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyanshrai/handwritten-signatures)

It contains genuine and forged signatures in RGB and grayscale formats across multiple users. Preprocessing was necessary to handle image format inconsistencies.

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

Contrary to expectation, deeper pre-trained networks (ResNet, AlexNet, VGG16) yielded only 50â€“60% accuracy. A **simple 3-layer CNN** performed significantly better, likely due to the nature of the task and the dataset size.

The final CNN includes:
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- Max pooling layers
- Fully connected layer
- Softmax classification

## ðŸ”§ Key Improvements

- Unified all input images to grayscale to eliminate inconsistencies.
- Instead of using standard `[255 255]` input dimensions, dynamically resized input to match actual image dimensions.
- This change alone boosted accuracy from ~70% to **91â€“92%**.
- Built a custom UI in MATLAB for dataset selection, training, and prediction.

## ðŸ’» Features

- MATLAB-based GUI for easy interaction
- High accuracy signature classification
- Custom preprocessing for better consistency and results
